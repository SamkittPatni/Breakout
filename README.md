# Breakout
Breakout game in Lua.
Game starts with a menu page. Player can choose to look at leaderboard or start the game. On starting game, player is asked to choose a paddle following which the level is started. 
Player launches the ball using spacebar. Player can move the paddle left to right using the 'a' and 'd' keys. Player gains points by hitting breaking the brick. Lives are lost when the ball falls below the screen. If all bricks are cleared, the level is complete and the next level is generated. Powerups are randomly generated and give player perks.
